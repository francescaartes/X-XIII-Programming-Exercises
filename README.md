# X-XIII-Programming-Exercises
Create programs using Java, Python, and C++ language for each of the following problems.

1. Astronomy Helper  
Create an application that displays the following menu: 
Select a Planet 
    1. Mercury 
    2. Venus 
    3. Earth 
    4. Mars 
    5. Exit the program
Enter your selection. 
When the user selects a planet from the menu, the program should display data about the planet’s
average distance from the sun, the planet’s mass, and the planet’s surface temperature. Use the
following data in your program: 

Mercury 
Average distance from the sun: 57.9 million kilometers 
Mass: 

3.31 × 10^23kg

Surface temperature: -173 to 430 degrees Celsius

Venus 
Average distance from the sun: 108.2 million kilometers 
Mass: 

4.87 × 10^24kg

Surface temperature: 472 degrees Celsius 

Earth
Average distance from the sun: 149.6 million kilometers 
Mass: 5.967 × 10^24kg
Surface temperature: -50 to 50 degrees Celsius 

Mars 
Average distance from the sun: 227.9 million kilometers 
Mass: 

0.6424 × 10^24kg

Surface temperature: -140 to 20 degrees Celsius  


2. Password Weakness Detector

Design a program that asks the user to enter a password, and then analyzes the password for the
following weaknesses: 
    Fewer than 8 characters 
    Does not contain at least one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter 
    Does not contain at least one numeric digit 
    Does not contain at least one special character (a character that is not a letter or a numeric digit) 
    Is a sequence of consecutive uppercase letters (such as ABCDE) 
    Is a sequence of consecutive lowercase letters (such as abcde) 
    Is a sequence of consecutive numeric digits (such as 12345) 
    Is a repeating sequence of characters (such as ZZZZZ or 55555) 
    The program should display messages indicating whether any of these weaknesses are found in the
    password.


3. Recursive Power Method    
Design a function that uses recursion to raise a number to a power. The function should accept two
arguments: the number to be raised and the exponent. Assume that the exponent is a nonnegative
integer.
